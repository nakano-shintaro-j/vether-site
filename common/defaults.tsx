    'unforgeable costliness and a fixed emission schedule. Vether mimics characteristics of Bitcoin,' +
    'where miners compete to expend capital to acquire newly-minted coins and chase ever-decreasing margins.' +
    'Instead of expending capital, Vether participants compete to purchase it by destroying capital on-chain.' +
    'As a result, all units of Vether are acquired at-cost and by anyone. This mechanism is called Proof-of-Value.'
